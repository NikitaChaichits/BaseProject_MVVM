# BaseProject

A base code which I almost use in every project I work on!
It shows how to build awesome project with Coroutines & Dagger by Clean Architecture in Kotlin!
This way you don`t need to repeat the same code in different parts of your project over & over.

Test keys.properties you can take in [additional] package and move to the root.
